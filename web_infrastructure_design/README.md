The domain name www.foobar.com that the user enters in his browser to access the website is displayed at the top.

The DNS request is then sent to the DNS server that resolves the domain name to the server's IP address.

The web server (Nginx) receives the HTTP request and handles the static requests directly, returning the HTML files, CSS, images, etc., to the user.

Dynamic requests are sent to the application server, which is responsible for processing the application logic and generating dynamic responses.

The application server can interact with the database (MySQL) to obtain or store data needed for the web application.

Finally, the response is sent back to the web server and then to the user, who views the website in his browser.
